# Advent Of C0de 2k17

This is a small puzzle game that i spot on HN, that propose a coding challenge a day until Xmas!

I found this game funny, here a list of my solutions, i try to use different languages in order to practice, some of them i don't really never used, so as additional challange i add the "learning" part to that when i pick up a language i never use.

NB: The quality of the code is bad and not "optimized" but i will eventually make it better overtime.

Merry Xmas!
